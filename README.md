# beginning-python-projects
A collection of code written for various online classes on Udemy, and EdX

I started learning to code in earnest around the same day I created my Github account in April 2017 after a discussion with a friend about how my education as a music theorist (PhD University of Oregon 2016) and my area of expertise being serial music (specifically the works of Anton Webern) would translate well into a career in data science. While at the time (and currently) I was beginning to get frustrated with attempting to break into teaching at the University level I thought that this would be a perfect topic to dive into. I was excited to start something truly new, and I have been maintaining that excitement since.
This repository represents the work that I have done with Python in some of the online classes I have been taking on Udemy and EdX. I hope to be able to track and show my progress as I go.
